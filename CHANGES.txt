0.3 (unreleased)

0.2 (2009-01-08)
================

* Added support for ``RelationList`` fields. This allows one to
  maintain a list of ``RelationValue`` objects that will be cataloged
  like the regular ``Relation`` fields.

* Get rid of ``IRelationInfo`` adapter requirement. Just define a
  ``create_relation`` function that does the same work.

* When looking for relations on an object be more tolerant if those
  cannot be found (just skip them) - this can happen when a schema is
  changed.

0.1 (2008-12-05)
================

* Initial public release.
